## 📖 How It Works  

1. Users sign up or log in to access the platform.  
2. Products are dynamically fetched and displayed from Sanity CMS.  
3. Users can add products to their cart. If not signed in, they are prompted to log in.  
4. Orders are processed securely, with Stripe managing payments.  
5. Stock is updated in real-time, and shipment tracking is provided for each order.
